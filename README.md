This repository includes some of the small scripts and code that I used
for quickly creating my OSCP documentation.

This was shared and referenced on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/johnhammond010).

* `generate_report.sh`

	This small BASH script is a little wrapper around the long `pandoc` command 
	to generate and create the PDF output for a report.

* `make_submission.sh`

	This small BASH script will bundle and package your appropriate exam and
	lab report into the 7z archive required to submit to Offensive Security.
